# CSE138_Assignment2_temp_rust

A basic HTTP web service with an in-memory key-value store that supports CRUD operations: adding, updating, and deleting key-value pairs, and retrieving values, which consists of a main instance handling requests and forwarding instances that relay requests to the main instance, with endpoints `/kvs/<key>` for GET and DELETE, and specific JSON-based request and response formats for PUT, enforced by constraints like as key length and request body structures.

## Acknowledgments

“The land on which we gather is the unceded territory of the Awaswas-speaking Uypi Tribe. The Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, comprised of the descendants of indigenous people taken to missions Santa Cruz and San Juan Bautista during Spanish colonization of the Central Coast, is today working hard to restore traditional stewardship practices on these lands and heal from historical trauma.”

I acknowledge that I reside on the land of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band of the Ohlone people.
